<!--# Hi there, I'm Eyob Alemayehu 👋

### Full Stack Software Engineer | Laravel & React Specialist

I am a software engineer with **4+ years of experience** building scalable web and mobile applications for the e-commerce, logistics, and telehealth industries. I specialize in bridging the gap between complex backend logic and intuitive frontend design.

My unique value lies in combining **international operational discipline** (gained from working with German and US consulting firms) with **startup resourcefulness** (demonstrated by leading critical local projects).

### 🚀 What I Bring to the Table

  - **End-to-End Ownership:** From architecting secure REST/GraphQL APIs in **Laravel/Node.js** to building responsive UIs in **React/Next.js**.
  - **Business Impact:** Engineered a payment automation system for a logistics platform that reduced manual financial reconciliation by **90%**.
  - **Remote Ready:** Proven track record of collaborating effectively with multicultural teams across different time zones (DACH region & USA).
